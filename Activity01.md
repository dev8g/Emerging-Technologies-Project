## Emerging Technologies in Agriculture Sector

**Drones** are revolutionizing agriculture, offering farmers precise insights and efficiency. In crop management, sensor-equipped drones monitor plant growth, detect disease stress, and apply pesticides or fertilizers at specific locations. In animal husbandry, drones track livestock movements and identify sick animals using thermal imaging. The inherent benefits lie in their ability to provide comprehensive, real-time data, empowering farmers for timely decision-making, ultimately enhancing productivity in modern farming practices.
