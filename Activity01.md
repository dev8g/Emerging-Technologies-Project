## 3 Emerging Technologies in Agriculture Sector

**Drones** are revolutionizing agriculture, offering farmers precise insights and efficiency. In crop management, sensor-equipped drones monitor plant growth, detect disease stress, and apply pesticides or fertilizers at specific locations. In animal husbandry, drones track livestock movements and identify sick animals using thermal imaging. The inherent benefits lie in their ability to provide comprehensive, real-time data, empowering farmers for timely decision-making, ultimately enhancing productivity in modern farming practices.

**Precision agriculture** revolutionizes farming by integrating GPS, sensors, drones, and data analytics. This approach optimizes crop management with real-time data on soil conditions, weather, and crop health. Farmers make precise, data-driven decisions, minimizing resource use. Targeted applications of water, fertilizers, and pesticides reduce waste and environmental impact. Precision agriculture enhances yields while promoting sustainable farming through efficient resource utilization.

**Blockchain** transforms agriculture by tracking plant information from farms to shelves, ensuring food quality and shelf life. This decentralized technology enables real-time monitoring of produce throughout the supply chain, fostering transparency. Walmart uses Hyperledger to detect compromised food, emphasizing blockchain's role in quality assurance. India, a major produce exporter, plans blockchain adoption to promote chemical-free farming and enhance transparency in agricultural exports. Blockchain emerges as a crucial tool, revolutionizing agriculture, ensuring food safety, and strengthening supply chain integrity.
